# FMLiveStreaming

This repository contains the prototype for Fremantles Live Streaming system, an internal tool designed for managing live streams, users, and shows. 

## Project Overview

This system provides a new and more efficient method for managing live streams, user accounts, and access to shows for Fremantle. Utilizing the Microsoft Azure tech stack, including Azure B2C and Cosmos DB to handle user management and data storage.

## Structure

The project is primarily composed of several HTML and CSS files, providing a prototype of the user interface. The pages include:

- `login.html`: Allows users to log into the system.
- `register.html`: Enables new users to create an account.
- `dashboard.html`: A user-friendly interface for administrators to manage live streams and users.
- `settings.html`: Enables users to manage their account settings.
- `show-catalog.html`: Lists the available shows for a user.
- `password-reset.html`: Lets users reset their forgotten password.

Each of these pages is styled using the accompanying `styles.css` file 

## Continued Development

This prototype will eventually be integrated with Azure B2C for user management and authentication, and Cosmos DB for data storage. More features and functionalities will be added to the project.
